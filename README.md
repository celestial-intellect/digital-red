# Digital-Red

Digital-Red is a collection of succinct, elegant OCaml implementations of the algorithms in the famous MIT red book of algorithms.

There is a pedagogical and programming angle to the effort, the implementations highlight the brevity of OCaml code, while preferring readability and non-redundancy over other concerns, although the running-time complexities of the algorithms should be correct.

The algorithms have a remarkable similarity to well-written pseudocodes of the same algorithms. The mathematical, abstract nature of ML derivative languages allow this incredible program-length efficiency and readability. OCaml in particular allows us to achieve the same with imperative code, mixing imperative and functional programming styles seamlessly.

Where possible, important exercises and samples are also tackled.

The first chapters are implemented, the intention is to implement all the algorithms in the textbook.

Programming is art.
